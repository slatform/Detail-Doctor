# Homepage (index.html) Improvement Plan

## Background and Motivation
The homepage is the first impression for visitors. While the current design is clean and functional, it can be enhanced to better communicate professionalism, trust, and the unique value of Detail Doctor. Improvements should focus on visual appeal, clarity, engagement, and conversion.

2. There is no clear summary of what makes Detail Doctor unique (e.g., trust, experience, mobile convenience).
3. No testimonials, reviews, or social proof are present.
4. The "Book Now" button does not link to a booking or contact flow.
5. The services section could use more detail, icons, or visuals.
6. No visible contact or social media links on the homepage.
7. No footer with business info, quick links, or copyright.
8. Accessibility and mobile experience can be further improved.
